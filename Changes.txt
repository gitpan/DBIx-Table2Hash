Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::Table2Hash.

1.10  Fri Jan 17 11:01:55 2003
	- Add method select_hashref() for when you want a hashref associated with
		each key, where the original method select() just associates a single
		value with each key. In this case, the constructor parameter
		value_column is ignored, and can be omitted
	- Change the sanity checks and error messages, now that value_column can
		be an optional parameter
	- Add an directory ,examples/, with a complete program which loads a table
		from a text file into the test database, and calls select_hashref()
		and select() to display the data. This demo also shows the way to use
		exception handling, and suggests one way to corrupt the source code
		in order to trigger an exception with die rather than with throw
	- Update the docs
	- Change use CGI; to use Carp;. So much for my scrupulous testing regime
